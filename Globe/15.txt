The ancient Olympic Games started in 776 BC, near Athens, Greece. These early games were based on even earlier games that were often held for important Greek festivals and weddings. The Greeks also liked to have games at funerals. These early games usually included races on foot and by chariot, as well as boxing and wrestling. Many Olympic events were based on soldiers' skills.
The games were held every four years. During the games, athletes would come from all over Greece. Many of the different Greek groups fought each other, but they would always agree to stop fighting so everyone could compete at the Games. After the games, they would continue their fighting.
